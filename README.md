# **Employee_Burnout_Analysis_and_Prediction_AI**



Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can have serious consequences on an individual's well-being and can lead to decreased productivity and job performance. In today's fast-paced and constantly connected world, it is increasingly important to recognize and address the signs of burnout in order to maintain the health and well-being of employees.

 we will be exploring the use of regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing a dataset containing various factors that may contribute to burnout such as workload, mental fatigue job and work-life balance, we can develop a model to identify individuals who may be at risk of burnout. By proactively addressing these risk factors, organizations can help prevent burnout and promote the well-being of their employees.

## **Dataset: Are Your Employees Burning Out?**
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blurredmachine/are-your-employees-burning-out?select=train.csv) consists of 9 columns as follows:

* **Employee ID**: The unique ID allocated for each employee **(example: fffe390032003000)**
* **Date of Joining**: The date-time when the employee has joined the organization **(example: 2008-12-30)**
* **Gender**: The gender of the employee **(Male/Female)**
* **Company Type**: The type of company where the employee is working **(Service/Product)**
* **WFH Setup Available**: Is the work from home facility available for the employee **(Yes/No)**
* **Designation**: The designation of the employee of work in the organization.
In the **range of [0.0, 5.0]** bigger is higher designation.
* **Resource Allocation**: The amount of resource allocated to the employee to work, ie. number of working hours.
In the **range of [1.0, 10.0]** (higher means more resource)
* **Mental Fatigue Score**: The level of fatigue mentally the employee is facing.
In the **range of [0.0, 10.0]** where 0.0 means no fatigue and 10.0 means completely fatigue.
* **Burn Rate**: The value we need to predict for each employee telling the rate of Bur out while working.
In the **range of [0.0, 1.0]** where the higher the value is more is the burn out.

The problem at hand is to analyze and predict employee burnout within an organization. The objective is to develop a model that can assess the likelihood of burnout for individual employees based on various factors such as workload, work-life balance, job satisfaction, organizational support, and personal characteristics.
